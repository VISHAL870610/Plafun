Key Features
Plafun is packed with features to streamline event planning. It is tailored to help users plan, manage, and track every aspect of their events, from budgeting to guest management.

1. Event Dashboard
The home screen provides an overview of the event status, with upcoming tasks, a quick snapshot of the budget, and guest RSVP updates.

2. Budget Tracker
The budget tracker ensures users stay within their spending limits by categorizing and visualizing expenses. It includes a progress bar to show the remaining budget.

3. Guest List Management
An easy-to-use guest management feature that allows users to add, track, and categorize invitees. Features include RSVP status, dietary preferences, and invitation management.

4. Vendor Booking
Users can browse, book, and track vendors for services like catering, photography, and entertainment. The app also includes vendor contract management.

5. Task Planner
A detailed to-do list with deadlines, priority levels, and progress indicators. This ensures that event planners stay on track and meet deadlines.

6. Event Scheduling
Planners can manage event schedules by assigning time slots to activities like ceremonies, speeches, meals, etc. It integrates smoothly with task management.

Design Objectives
1. User-Centered Design
The app is built with the goal of providing a simple, intuitive, and engaging experience, focusing on user needs, accessibility, and ease of use.

2. Visual Design Consistency
Consistency in layout and design elements ensures that users can easily navigate through the app and find the tools they need.

3. Mobile-First Approach
The design is optimized for mobile use, ensuring users have a seamless experience while managing events on the go.

Tools Used
Figma: Used for wireframing, designing high-fidelity mockups, and prototyping interactive features.

Icons: Custom icons were created using Figma plugins, ensuring they match the appâ€™s minimalist aesthetic.

Color Palette: A soothing Teal and Blush Gradient was chosen to provide a calm and elegant feel, perfect for both professional and personal events.

Typography: Clean, modern fonts like Roboto and Poppins ensure readability and a professional look.

Design Process
1. User Research
Conducted surveys and interviews with potential users to understand their needs, pain points, and expectations for an event management tool.

Analyzed competitors to find areas of improvement and opportunities for innovation.

2. Wireframing & Prototyping
Started with low-fidelity wireframes to map out the user flow and app structure.

Developed interactive high-fidelity prototypes using Figma, iterating upon design concepts based on feedback.

3. User Testing
Conducted usability testing to evaluate the intuitiveness of the app, gather feedback, and identify areas that required optimization.

Visual Preview
Here are a few highlights of the design:

Event Dashboard: Clean, concise layout with real-time updates on event status.

Budget Tracker: Intuitive bar chart and expense breakdown.

Guest List: Streamlined interface for managing and categorizing invitees.

Vendor Booking: Interactive calendar view to track vendor schedules and deadlines.

Challenges and Solutions
Challenges
Ensuring Simple, Yet Effective Design: The challenge was to design an app that was simple and approachable for users who might not be tech-savvy, while still including all the essential features for comprehensive event planning.

Cross-Platform Consistency: Ensuring that the design worked seamlessly across mobile and desktop platforms required extensive testing and adjustments.

Solutions
Focused on minimalist design principles, using intuitive icons and navigation that were easily recognizable.

Responsive design adjustments were made to ensure the app functioned smoothly on various screen sizes.

Conclusion
The Plafun project was a fantastic learning experience that allowed me to practice my UI/UX design skills while working on a real-world project. It deepened my understanding of the design process, from user research to prototyping and testing. This internship not only helped me grow as a designer but also improved my ability to design with user experience as the core focus.
